# Automatic Snake Game

Welcome to the Automatic Snake Game! This project showcases a classic snake game with a twist â€“ it's powered by AI algorithms to find the shortest path and solve traveling challenges. 

## Features

- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes AI algorithms to navigate the snake, optimizing for the shortest path and efficient travel.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Automatically adapts to different game scenarios, providing a challenging and engaging experience.
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Detects and adapts to various monitor setups using the Win32 API.
- **Visual Display**: Renders the game on a Tkinter canvas for a simple and interactive visual experience.



## How It Works

The game utilizes a combination of AI algorithms to control the snake. These algorithms are designed to find the shortest path to the target, navigate obstacles, and optimize the snake's movement to avoid collisions.

### Key Components

- **AI Algorithms**: Implements shortest path algorithms and traveling solutions to control the snake.
- **Tkinter**: Used for rendering the game interface and handling user inputs.
- **Win32 API**: Detects monitor setup to ensure the game adapts to different screen configurations.
